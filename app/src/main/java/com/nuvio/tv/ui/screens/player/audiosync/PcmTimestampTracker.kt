 * Timestamps can identify a whole group of compressed packets, so several decoded PCM buffers

 * by the actual PCM frame count; a distinct timestamp outside the normal jitter window reanchors
 * the clock, leaving real seeks and missing audio for SpeechAnalyzer to detect as discontinuities.
 * Used only by sync analysis; the player's audio and timestamps are never changed.
