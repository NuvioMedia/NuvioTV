/**
 * Reads the rewatch sessions of an account and keeps the ones that look like a run.
 *
 * Simkl keeps a rewatch in its own session and never moves the canonical watch position, so a client
 * that reads only the canonical row offers the episode the user finished months ago, or nothing at
 * all. The sessions are the only place that knows where the run is, and they live on the account, so
 * a run read from here shows up on every device the user signs in on.
 *
 * Sessions are merged per series first, because Simkl splits a running rewatch into a new session
 * once the same episode is rewatched 48 hours later; the run itself continues across the split.
 * Episodes then have to form a chain of consecutive numbers inside one season, and the chain holding
 * the most recently rewatched episode is the run. How long that chain has to be is the user's
 * choice; see [SimklRewatchNextUpMode].
 *
 * Difference from mobile: mobile takes `animeIdPreference` and groups through
 * `canonicalContentId(preference)`. The TV `SimklMedia.canonicalContentId()` takes no parameter and
 * keeps the anime preference in `SimklAnimeIdPreferenceHolder`, so grouping on `contentId` goes
 * through it and the preference shows up only in the rest of the pipeline.
