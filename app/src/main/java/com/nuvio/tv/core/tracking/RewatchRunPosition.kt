/**
 * Where a rewatch run stands: the last episode of a series the user rewatched.
 *
 * Simkl keeps a rewatch in its own session and never moves the canonical watch position, so the
 * Continue Watching row would keep pointing at the episode the user finished months ago. A run
 * position turns the series into a next-up card that follows the rewatch instead: a run at S01E02
 * offers S01E03 next.
 *
 * The position is read from the tracking account (see `deriveSimklRewatchRuns`) rather than stored on
 * device, so the row behaves the same on every device the user signs in on. The rule for what
 * counts as a run lives with that reader, and the reader takes its length from the user's mode: a
 * single rewatched episode is enough in the default mode, two in a row are needed in the stricter one.
 *
 * [matchKeys] holds every ID form of the series (imdb, tmdb, tvdb, simkl, the catalogue id), because
 * the Continue Watching pipeline builds its series key from whichever id the playback carried.
